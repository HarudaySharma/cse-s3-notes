*Jitter refers to the <span style="color:#00ffcc">variation in the packet arrival time</span>*. It is the uneven delay in the delivery of audio or video packets.

>[!example] 
>let us assume that video packets are sent every 3D ms. If some of the packets arrive with 3D-ms delay and others with 4D-ms delay, an uneven quality in the video is the result.
