 A *transport layer protocol* can *either* be **connection less** or **connection-oriented**.
##### Connectionless  Service :
- The *packets* are *sent* from *one party* to *another* with **no need** for **connection establishment** or **connection release**.
- The *packets* are **not numbered**
	- They *may be* *<u>delayed</u>* or *<u>lost</u>* or may *arrive* *<u>out of sequence</u>*.
	- There is **no acknowledgement** either.
- **UDP**, is connection less.
##### Connection-Oriented  Service :
- A *connection* is first **established** b/w the *sender* and the *receiver*. 
- *Data* are *transferred*.
- In the end, the *connection* is **released**.
- **TCP**, **SCTP** are connection-oriented.
