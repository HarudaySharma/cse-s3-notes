- Nodes are connected to the bus cable by [[ drop lines]] and [[taps]].
- Signal becomes weaker and weaker as it travels farther and farther, due to [[energy conversion as signal travels]].
- here is a limit on the number of taps a bus can support and on the distance between those [[taps]].
- The most common <span style="color:#00ffff">access method</span> is [[CSMA]] in bus topology.
*bus topology*

**Advantages :-**
1. ease of installation.
2. uses less cabling than mesh or star topologies.

**Disadvantages :-**
1. difficult reconnection and fault isolation.
2. difficult to add new devices.
3. *[[degradation in quality]]*.
4. **Not Robust**, if ***main*** communication ***line*** (bus) encounters issues (***breaks***) the entire ***n/w*** can go ***down***. 
5. Adding new devices may require modification or replacement of the backbone.

***Bus topology was the one of the<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> first topologies </mark>used in the design of early local-area networks.***
