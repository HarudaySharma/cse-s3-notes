>[!note] *in carrier sense multiple access*
>- It is a **carrier sense multiple access** based on media access protocol to sense the traffic on a channel (idle or busy) before transmitting the data.
>- It means that if the channel is idle, the station can send data to the channel. Otherwise, it must wait until the channel becomes idle.
>- Hence, it reduces the chances of a collision on a transmission medium.
