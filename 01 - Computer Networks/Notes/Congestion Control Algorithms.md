In the network layer
- before the network can make Quality of service guarantees,
	- it must know what traffic is being guaranteed.
- One of the *main causes* of **congestion** is that **traffic** is often **bursty**.

<u>**Traffic Shaping**</u> ->
- Traffic Shaping is a *mechanism* to **control** the **amount** and the **rate** of *traffic sent* to the *network*. 
- Approach of congestion management is called Traffic shaping.
- Traffic shaping *helps* to ***regulate*** the ***rate*** of ***data transmission*** and **reduces congestion**.

#### *Types of Traffic Shaping Algorithms :*

##### *[[Leaky Bucket algorithm]]*
##### *[[Token Bucket algorithm]]*
