- *Process-to-process* delivery *needs* **two identifiers**,
	- *IP address* and 
	- *Port number*,
		- At *each end* to *make* a *connection*.
- The *combination* of an *<u>IP address</u>* and a *<u>port number</u>* is called a **socket address**.
- The <u>*client socket address*</u> *defines* the **client process** uniquely
- The <u>*server socket address*</u> *defines* the **server process** uniquely.

%%A transport layer protocol needs a pair of socket addresses:
- The client socket address and 
- The server socket address.
	- To make a connection.%%
