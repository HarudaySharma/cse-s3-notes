 - The sequence number of the frame occupies a field in the frame. So, the sequence number should be kept to a minimum.
 - The sequence number ranges from 0 to 2 k-1 if the frame header allows k bits.
 - The sender maintains a list of sequence numbers that are only allowed to be sent by the sender.
 - The sender window can only be 2 k-1 in size.
 - For example, if the frame allows 4 bits, the windowâ€™s size is 2 raised to the power 4 - 1=((2^4)-1) =16-1=15.
 - The sender has a buffer with the same size as the window.
