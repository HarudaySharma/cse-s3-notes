- A hub is basically a ***multiport repeater.***

- It ***connects multiple wires*** coming from *different  branches*,
	 *for example* : ***connector in star topology***.

- they ***cannot filter data***, so data **packets** are ***sent to all connected devices.***

- therefore, collision domain of all hosts connected through *Hub* remains one.

- they **don't have intelligence** to *find out best path for data packets*, hence *leads to inefficiencies and wastage*.

##### Types of Hubs:

- [[Active Hub]].
- [[Passive Hub]].
- [[Intelligent Hub]].
