**OSI -** ***(Open Systems Interconnection)***

##### What is OSI Model ?

- OSI is a reference model that describes how *information from a software application* in *one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.*

- OSI model was developed by the [[ISO]]  in 1984.

- OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.

##### Fundamentals / Characteristics of OSI Model :

###### *[[Layered Architecture]] :*
	> This model is composed of seven ordered layers.
	> Where each layer defines a family of functions distinct from those of the other  layers.

###### *[[Peer-to-Peer Processes]] :*
	> At physical layer, communication is direct. 
	> At the higher layers, however, communication must move down through the layers.
	> Each layer in the sending device adds its own information to the message it receives from the layer just above it.

###### *[[Encapsulation]] :-*
	Figure 2.3 reveals another aspect of data communications in the OSI model: encapsulation.


##### Layers in the OSI Model :

	There are the seven OSI layers. Each layer has different functions.


| *Layer Number*   |         1          |          2          |         3         |          4          |         5         |           6            |           7           |
