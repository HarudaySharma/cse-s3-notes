- On the receiver side, the size of the window is always 1.
- The receiver acknowledges a frame by sending an ACK frame to the sender, along with the sequence number of the next expected frame.
- The receiver declares explicitly that it is ready to receive N subsequent frames, starting with the specified number.
- We use this scheme in order to acknowledge multiple frames.
- The receiverâ€™s window can hold 2,3,4 frames, but the ACK frame will be held until frame 4 arrives. It will send the
- ACK along with sequence number 5 after the arrival, with which the acknowledgment of 2,3,4 will be done one at a time.
- The receiver requires a buffer size of one.
