|                                           |                                                         |                                                             |
|         Connection Establishment          |        No connection setup before data transfer.        |           A virtual circuit is established first.           |
|            Routing Flexibility            |   Packets take variable routes to reach destination.    |              Packets follow a predefined path.              |
|            Packet Independence            |          Each packet is treated independently.          |       Packets are part of a sequence in the circuit.        |
|             Order of Delivery             | No guarantee of the order in which packets will arrive. |           Preserves the order of packet delivery.           |
|                 Overhead                  |    Lower overhead as no connection setup is needed.     |          Higher overhead due to connection setup.           |
|                 Examples                  |            Internet's IP network (e.g., UDP)            |                    Frame Relay networks                     |
