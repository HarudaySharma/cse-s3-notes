- Layer 4, the [[transport layer]], links the two subgroups.
- Layers 5, 6, and 7 are [[user support layers]].

*==NOTE==*
- ***upper OSI layers are almost always implemented in software.***
- ***lower layers are a combination of hardware and software.***
- ***but physical layer is mostly hardware.***

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">At each layer, a header, or possibly a trailer, can be added to the data unit.</mark>
