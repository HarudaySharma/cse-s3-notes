- It is a ***multi port bridge with a buffer***.
- It data link layer device.
- It has a ***design that can boost its efficiency***`(large number of ports imply less traffic)`.
- can perform error checking before forwarding data.
	it *does not forward packets that have errors* and *forward good packets selectively to correct port only*.
- It *divides collision domain of hosts*. But,
- *broadcast domain remains same*.

##### *possible frame forwarding approaches:*

- [[Cut-through]].
- [[Collision-free]].
- [[Fully buffered]].

##### *Types of switches:*

1. [[Unmanaged switches]].
2. [[Managed switches]].
3. [[Smart switches]].
