- It is a transport layer protocol that *facilitates* the *transmission* of *packets* from *source* to *destination*.
- It is a **connection-oriented** protocol,
	- Means it *establishes* the *connection prior* to the *communication* that occurs between the computing devices in a network.
- This protocol is *used with* an *IP protocol*, so *together*, they are *referred* to as a **TCP/IP**.

##### Working :
- The main *functionality* of the **TCP** is to *take* the *data* from the *application layer*. 
	- Then it *divides* the data *into* a *several packets*,
	- Provides *numbering* to these *packets*,
	- And finally *transmits* these *packets* to the *destination*.
- The **TCP**, on the *other side*,
	- Will *reassemble* the *packets* and *transmits* them *to* the *application layer*. 
- *As* we know that **TCP** is a *connection-oriented protocol*,
	- So the *connection* will *remain established* until the *communication* is *not completed* between the *sender* and the *receiver*.
