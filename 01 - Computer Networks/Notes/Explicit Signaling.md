In explicit signaling :-
- if a *node experiences congestion* 
	- it can *explicitly* ==sends a packet== to the **source** or **destination** to ==inform about congestion==.
- The *difference* between <u>choke packet</u> and <u>explicit signalling</u> is that
	- the *signal* is ==included in the packets that carry data== rather than creating a different packet as in case of choke packet technique.

>[!important] *Explicit signaling can occur in either forward or backward direction.*
