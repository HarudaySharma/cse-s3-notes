Use dynamic routing algorithms.

***types of algorithms***:

- **Distance vector** - Based on *hop count*,
	- *periodically broadcasts the routing table* to other routers 
	- takes *more network bandwidth* especially with *more routers*.
	
- **Link state** - Routing tables are *broadcast at startup* and then *only when they change*.
