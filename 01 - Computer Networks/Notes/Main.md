# Data Communication

### *What is data communication ?*

Data <span style="color:cyan">communications</span> are the exchange of data between two devices via some
form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. 

The word **Data** refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by
the parties creating and using the data.

**Remember the definition of [[Telecommunication]] too**.

***
### *Characteristics on which Effectiveness of Data Communication depends :-*

- [[Delivery]]
- [[Accuracy]]
- [[Timeliness]]
- [[Jitter]]

---
### *Components of Data Communication :-*

- [[Message]]
- [[Sender]]
- [[Receiver]]
- [[Transmission medium]]
- [[Protocol]]

### *Data Representation :*

##### [[Ways in which data can be represented]]
---
### *Data Flow :*

Communication between two devices can be *one of the following only*.
- [[Simplex]]
- [[Half-duplex]] 
- [[Full-duplex]]

*Data flow (simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex)*

# Networks

A network is a set of devices {[[nodes]]} connected by communication [[ links]].
### *What is a Computer Network?*

- A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. 
<span style="color:#00ff4b">The links connecting the nodes are known as communication channels.</span>
- Computer Network uses [[distributed processing]].

## *Uses of Computer Network :*

- [[Resource sharing]]
- [[Server-Client model]]
- [[Communication medium]]
- [[E-commerce]]

---
## *Network Criteria :*

There are many criteria's which must be meet by a network, the **most important** of them are <span style="color:#00ff4b">performance</span>, <span style="color:#00ff4b">reliability</span> and <span style="color:#00ff4b">security</span> . 

- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">performance</span>*** can be measured in many ways, including [[transit time]] and [[response time]]. and it depends on number of factors, including the ***number of users, transmission medium, connected hardware and efficiency of the software.***
	- *performance is evaluated by two [[networking metrics]]*
- **network** ***<span style="color:#00ffff">reliability</span>*** *is measured by the frequency of failure, time taken by a link to recover from a failure, and network's robustness in a catastrophe.* 
- **network** ***<span style="color:#00ffff">security</span>*** *includes :*
	- *protecting data from unauthorized access*
	- *protecting data from damage and development*
	- *implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.* 

---
## *Types of N/W Connections :*

There are mainly **two types** of network connections that two or more than two devices can have, to communicate with each other.

*those are :* 
	1. [[Point-to-Point]] communication n/w.
	2. [[Multipoint]] communication n/w.


---
## *Topologies :*

- Topologies in computer network *refer* to the **<span style="color:#01ff07">physical or logical layout of a network</span>**.
- It **defines** *how network devices are connected and how data flows between them.*

#### *Physical Topology :-*

It is the **geometric representation of all the nodes in a network.**

***There are Four basic topologies possible :*** 
	*mesh, star, bus, and ring*.

- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">Mesh Topology</span> :*** 
				*In [[mesh topology]], every device has a **[[dedicated]]** [[Point-to-Point]] link to every device.*
- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">Star Topology</span> :*** 
				*In [[star topology]], each device has a dedicated [[Point-to-Point]] link only to a central controller, usually called a hub.*
-  ***<span style="color:#00ffff">Bus Topology</span> :*** 
				*In [[bus topology]], one long cable act as a backbone to link all the devices in a network.*
- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">Ring Topology</span> :*** 
				*In [[ring topology]],  each device has a dedicated [[Point-to-Point]] connection with only the two devices on either side of it.*
- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">Hybrid Topology</span> :*** 
				A network can be hybrid.
				*For example*,  we can have a main star topology with each branch connecting several stations in a bus topology.

## *Network Models :*


- As we know **Computer networks** are created by different entities.
	therefore, **Standards** are needed so that these *heterogenous networks* can communicate with each other.
- Two best-known standards are :-
	- [[OSI model]].
	- [[TCP-IP Protocol Suite]].
- [[OSI Model VS TCP IP Model]]

## *Categories of Networks :*

Nowadays when we speak of network, we are generally referring to *four primary categories :*

|               |            Pan            |          Lan           |          Wan          |                 Man                 |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|  *full name*  | [[Personal-Area Network]] | [[Local-Area Network]] | [[Wide-Area Network]] |    [[Metropolitan-Area network]]    |
| *covers area* |  over range of a person   |   less than 2 miles    |   can be worldwide    | medium-sized areas `(campus, city)` |

#### [[LAN vs MAN vs WAN]]

## *Network Devices :*

Network devices, also known as **networking hardware**, are *physical devices* that <span style="color:#01ff07">allow</span> *<span style="color:#00ffff">hardware on a computer network</span>* to ***<span style="color:#00ffff">communicate with one another</span>***.
