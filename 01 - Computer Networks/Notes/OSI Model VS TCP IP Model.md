|  **Full Form**  |     |            OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.            | TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. |
|   **Layers**    |     |                          It has 7 layers.                          |                          It has 4 layers.                          |
|    **Usage**    |     |                        It is low in usage.                         |                         It is mostly used.                         |
|  **Approach**   |     |                    It is vertically approached.                    |                   It is horizontally approached.                   |
|  **Delivery**   |     |        Delivery of the package is guaranteed in OSI Model.         |     Delivery of the package is not guaranteed in TCP/IP Model.     |
| **Replacement** |     | Replacement of tools and changes can easily be done in this model. |       Replacing the tools is not easy as it is in OSI Model.       |
| **Reliability** |     |               It is less reliable than TCP/IP Model.               |                It is more reliable than OSI Model.                 |
