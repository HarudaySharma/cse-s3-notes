|                                               |     |                                                                    |                                                                    |
|                 **Full Form**                 |     |            OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.            | TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. |
|                  **Layers**                   |     |                          It has 7 layers.                          |                          It has 4 layers.                          |
|                   **Usage**                   |     |                        It is low in usage.                         |                         It is mostly used.                         |
|                 **Approach**                  |     |                    It is vertically approached.                    |                   It is horizontally approached.                   |
|                 **Delivery**                  |     |        Delivery of the package is guaranteed in OSI Model.         |     Delivery of the package is not guaranteed in TCP/IP Model.     |
|                **Replacement**                |     | Replacement of tools and changes can easily be done in this model. |       Replacing the tools is not easy as it is in OSI Model.       |
|                **Reliability**                |     |               It is less reliable than TCP/IP Model.               |                It is more reliable than OSI Model.                 |
