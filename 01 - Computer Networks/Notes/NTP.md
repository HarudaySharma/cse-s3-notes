- NTP stands for Network Time Protocol.
- It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source.

- It is very useful in situations like bank transactions.
	- Assume the following situation without the presence of NTP. Suppose you carry out a transaction, where your computer reads the time at 2:30 PM while the server records it at 2:28 PM. The server can crash very badly if itâ€™s out of sync.
