There are many criteria's which must be meet by a network, the **most important** of them are <span style="color:#00ff4b">performance</span>, <span style="color:#00ff4b">reliability</span> and <span style="color:#00ff4b">security</span> . 

- ***<span style="color:#00ffff">performance</span>*** can be measured in many ways, including [[transit time]] and [[response time]]. and it depends on number of factors, including the ***number of users, transmission medium, connected hardware and efficiency of the software.***
	- performance is evaluated by two [[networking metrics]]
- **network** ***<span style="color:#00ffff">reliability</span>*** is measured by the frequency of failure, time taken by a link to recover from a failure, and network's robustness in a catastrophe. 
- **network** ***<span style="color:#00ffff">security</span>*** includes :
	- *protecting data from unauthorized access*
	- *protecting data from damage and development*
	- *implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.*
