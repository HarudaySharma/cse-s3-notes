- It *provides* a ==connection-oriented reliable service==, which means that it *guarantees* the *delivery* of *data packets*.
	- If the data *packet* is **lost** across the network, then the TCP will **resend** the *lost packets*.
- It *provides* a ==flow control mechanism== *using* a **sliding window protocol**.
- It *provides* ==error detection== by *using* **checksum** and ==error control== by *using* **Go Back** or **ARP** *protocol*.
- It ==eliminates== the ==congestion== by *using* a <u>**network congestion avoidance algorithm**</u> that *includes* various *schemes* such as [[AIMD]], **slow start**, and **congestion window**.
