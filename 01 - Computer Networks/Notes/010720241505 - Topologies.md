- Topologies in computer network *refer* to the **<span style="color:#01ff07">physical or logical layout of a network</span>**.
- It **defines** *how network devices are connected and how data flows between them.*

#### *Physical Topology :-*

It is the ==geometric representation of all the nodes in a network==.

**There are Four basic topologies possible :**
*mesh, star, bus, and ring*.

###### Mesh Topology : 

In [[mesh topology]], every device has a **[[dedicated]]** [[Point-to-Point]] link to every device.

###### Star Topology :

In [[star topology]], each device has a dedicated [[Point-to-Point]] link only to a central controller, usually called a hub.

###### Bus Topology : 

In [[bus topology]], one long cable act as a backbone to link all the devices in a network.

###### Ring Topology : 

In [[ring topology]],  each device has a dedicated [[Point-to-Point]] connection with only the two devices on either side of it.

###### Hybrid Topology : 

A network can be hybrid.
*For example*,  we can have a main star topology with each branch connecting several stations in a bus topology.
