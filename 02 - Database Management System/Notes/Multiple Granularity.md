Multiple [[Granularity]] can be *defined* as **hierarchically breaking** up the database **into** **blocks** which *can be*  *locked*.

- The Multiple Granularity protocol enhances concurrency and reduces lock overhead.
- It maintains the track of what to lock and how to lock.
- It makes easy to decide either to lock a data item or to unlock a data item. This [[Example of Multiple Granularity tree hierarchy|type of hierarchy can be graphically represented as a tree]].
