*If* in a *schedule,*
- A *transaction performs* a **dirty read operation** *from* an *uncommitted transaction*.
- And its **commit operation** is **delayed** till the *uncommitted transaction* either *commits* or *roll backs* 
- Then such a schedule is known as aÂ **Recoverable Schedule**.

>[!important] *Here*,
>- The commit operation of the transaction that performs the dirty read is delayed.
>- This ensures that it still has a chance to recover if the uncommitted transaction fails later.
