>[!example] 
>- Consider a tree which has four levels of nodes.
>- The first level or higher level shows the entire database.
>- The second level represents a node of type area.
>- The higher level database consists of exactly these areas.
>- The area consists of children nodes which are known as files.
>	- No file can be present in more than one area
>- Finally, each file contains child nodes known as records.
>- The file has exactly those records that are its child nodes. No records represent in more than one file.
>- Hence, the levels of the tree starting from the top level are as follows:
>	- Database
>	- Area
>	- File
>	- Record
>
>*in this tree the highest level shows the entire database. The levels below are file, record, and fields.*
