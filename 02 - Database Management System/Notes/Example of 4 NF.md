>[!example] 
>Consider the relation EMP shown in below Figure. A tuple in this EMP relation represents the fact that an employee whose name is Ename works on the project whose name is Pname and has a dependent whose name is Dname. An employee may work on several projects and may have several dependents and employee’s projects and dependents are independent on one another. To keep the relation state consistent, we must have a separate tuple to represent every combination of an employee’s dependent and an employee’s project. This constraint is specified as a multivalued dependency on the EMP relation.
