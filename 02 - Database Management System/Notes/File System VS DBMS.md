- ***what is a [[file system]] ?*** 

| Basics                       | File System                                                                            | DBMS                                                                                                                             |     |

| Structure                    | The file system is a way of arranging the files in a storage medium within a computer. | DBMS is software for managing the database.                                                                                      |     |
| Data Redundancy              | Redundant data can be present in a file system.                                        | In DBMS there is no redundant data.                                                                                              |     |
| Backup and Recovery          | It doesnâ€™t provide Inbuilt mechanism for backup and recovery of data if it is lost.    | It provides in house tools for backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.                                                   |     |
| Query processing             | There is no efficient query processing in the file system.                             | Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.                                                                                     |     |
| Consistency                  | There is less data consistency in the file system.                                     | There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization.                                                          |     |
| Complexity                   | It is less complex as compared to DBMS.                                                | It has more complexity in handling as compared to the file system.                                                               |     |
| Security Constraints         | File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.                              | DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file systems.                                                                   |     |
| Cost                         | It is less expensive than DBMS.                                                        | It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.                                                                           |     |
| Data Independence            | There is no data independence.                                                         | In DBMS data independence exists, mainly of two types:<br><br>1) Logical Data Independence.<br><br>2)Physical Data Independence. |     |
| User Access                  | Only one user can access data at a time.                                               | Multiple users can access data at a time.                                                                                        |     |
| Meaning                      | The users are not required to write procedures.                                        | The user has to write procedures for managing databases                                                                          |     |
| Sharing                      | Data is distributed in many files. So, it is not easy to share data.                   | Due to centralized nature data sharing is easy                                                                                   |     |
| Data Abstraction             | It give details of storage and representation of data                                  | It hides the internal details of Database                                                                                        |     |
| Integrity Constraints        | Integrity Constraints are difficult to implement                                       | Integrity constraints are easy to implement                                                                                      |     |
| ****Attribute****_****s****_ | To access data in a file , user requires attributes such as file name, file location.  | No such attributes are required.                                                                                                 |     | 
| Example                      | Cobol, C++                                                                             | Oracle, SQL Server                                                                                                               |     |
