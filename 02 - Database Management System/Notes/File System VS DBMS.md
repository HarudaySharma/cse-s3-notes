- ***what is a [[file system]] ?*** 

|        Basics         |                                      File System                                       |                                                               DBMS                                                               |     |     |

|       Structure       | The file system is a way of arranging the files in a storage medium within a computer. |                                           DBMS is software for managing the database.                                            |     |     |
|    Data Redundancy    |                    Redundant data can be present in a file system.                     |                                               In DBMS there is no redundant data.                                                |     |     |
|  Backup and Recovery  |  It doesn’t provide Inbuilt mechanism for backup and recovery of data if it is lost.   |                          It provides in house tools for backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.                          |     |     |
|      Consistency      |                   There is less data consistency in the file system.                   |                             There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization.                              |     |     |
|      Complexity       |                        It is less complex as compared to DBMS.                         |                                It has more complexity in handling as compared to the file system.                                |     |     |
| Security Constraints  |               File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.                |                                  DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file systems.                                  |     |     |
|         Cost          |                            It is less expensive than DBMS.                             |                                      It has a comparatively higher cost than a file system.                                      |     |     |
|   Data Independence   |                             There is no data independence.                             | In DBMS data independence exists, mainly of two types:<br><br>1) Logical Data Independence.<br><br>2)Physical Data Independence. |     |     |
|      User Access      |                        Only one user can access data at a time.                        |                                            Multiple users can access data at a time.                                             |     |     |
|        Meaning        |                    The users are not required to write procedures.                     |                                     The user has to write procedures for managing databases                                      |     |     |
|        Sharing        |          Data is distributed in many files. So, it is not easy to share data.          |                                          Due to centralized nature data sharing is easy                                          |     |     |
|   Data Abstraction    |                 It give details of storage and representation of data                  |                                            It hides the internal details of Database                                             |     |     |
| Integrity Constraints |                    Integrity Constraints are difficult to implement                    |                                           Integrity constraints are easy to implement                                            |     |     |
|      Attributes       | To access data in a file , user requires attributes such as file name, file location.  |                                                 No such attributes are required.                                                 |     |     |
|        Example        |                                       Cobol, C++                                       |                                                        Oracle, SQL Server                                                        |     |     |
